## Why bun?
We want to use a package manager that has built-in TypeScript support and a fast runtime.

1. Built-in TypeScript support
    - Bun has built-in TypeScript support, so we don't need to install a separate TypeScript compiler like ts-node or nodemon
2. Fast runtime
    - It doesn't need separate dev dependecies for Typescript types - it handles them automatically
3. No build step needed for development
    - We can use Bun to run the project directly, so we don't need to build the project before running it
