## Project Structure
<!-- Explain the project structure and how the files are organized -->
Utilised a monorepo approach to manage the project for the following reasons:
1. To keep the project organised and easy to manage
2. To allow easier sharing of types between the frontend and backend
3. To learn Docker Compose and how to use it to manage the project
